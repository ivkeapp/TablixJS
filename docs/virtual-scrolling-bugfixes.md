# Virtual Scrolling Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Row Selection Not Working
**Problem**: Row selection was not functioning in virtual scrolling mode even when enabled.

**Root Cause**: Virtual scrolling dynamically renders rows, but the selection manager's event listeners were only attached to the initial DOM elements.

**Solution**: 
- Added event delegation in `VirtualScrollManager.setupEventDelegation()`
- Implemented proper event forwarding to the selection manager
- Added `updateSelectionStates()` method to maintain visual selection state
- Added listeners for selection change events to update row appearance

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Event delegation for dynamically rendered rows
setupEventDelegation() {
  this.scrollContainer.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    const row = event.target.closest('.tablix-row');
    if (!row) return;
    
    const rowIndex = parseInt(row.getAttribute('data-virtual-index'));
    const rowData = this.data[rowIndex];
    
    if (rowData) {
      this.table.eventManager.trigger('rowClick', {
        rowData, rowIndex, originalEvent: event, element: row
      });
    }
  });
}
```

### 2. ✅ Scrollbar Dragging Issues
**Problem**: When dragging the scrollbar rapidly, rows would sometimes not render until manual scroll wheel movement.

**Root Cause**: The throttled scroll handler (16ms delay) was too slow for rapid scrollbar dragging, causing missed scroll events.

**Solution**:
- Added immediate scroll handling with `handleScrollImmediate()`
- Implemented scroll velocity detection
- Added specific mousedown/mouseup handlers for scrollbar interaction
- Reduced throttle delay from 16ms to 8ms for better responsiveness
- Added high-frequency updates during scrollbar dragging (~120fps)

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Immediate scroll handling for fast scrolling
handleScrollImmediate() {
  const now = performance.now();
  const scrollTop = this.scrollContainer.scrollTop;
  
  // Calculate scroll velocity
  if (this.lastScrollTime && this.lastScrollTop !== undefined) {
    const timeDelta = now - this.lastScrollTime;
    const scrollDelta = Math.abs(scrollTop - this.lastScrollTop);
    this.scrollVelocity = timeDelta > 0 ? scrollDelta / timeDelta : 0;
  }
  
  // For very fast scrolling, schedule immediate update
  if (this.scrollVelocity > 2) {
    this.scheduleUpdate();
  }
}
```

### 3. ✅ Image Loading During Fast Scrolling
**Problem**: Images would sometimes not load or appear broken during rapid scrolling.

**Root Cause**: Browser image loading was being interrupted by frequent DOM updates during virtual scrolling.

**Solution**:
- Added `handleImageLoading()` method with proper image lifecycle management
- Implemented loading states and placeholders
- Added fade-in transitions for smooth image appearance
- Error handling for failed image loads with fallback placeholders

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Optimized image loading
handleImageLoading() {
  const images = this.tableBody.querySelectorAll('.tablix-row img');
  
  images.forEach(img => {
    if (img.complete || img.classList.contains('loading')) return;
    
    img.classList.add('loading');
    img.style.opacity = '0.5';
    img.style.transition = 'opacity 0.2s ease';
    
    const handleLoad = () => {
      img.classList.remove('loading');
      img.style.opacity = '1';
    };
    
    img.addEventListener('load', handleLoad);
    img.addEventListener('error', handleLoad);
  });
}
```

## Performance Improvements

- **Scroll Responsiveness**: Reduced throttle delay from 16ms to 8ms (~120fps)
- **Scrollbar Dragging**: Added dedicated high-frequency updates during scrollbar interaction
- **Image Loading**: Implemented lazy loading with smooth transitions
- **Selection Performance**: Optimized selection state updates to only affect visible rows

## Testing

Run the bug fix tests:
- `virtual-scroll-bugfix-test.html` - Focused testing for specific fixes
- `virtual-scroll-demo.html` - Full demo with all features
- `virtual-scroll-test-suite.html` - Comprehensive test suite

## Verification Steps

1. **Selection Test**:
   - Click rows to select (should work immediately)
   - Use Ctrl+Click for multi-selection
   - Scroll away and back - selection should persist
   - Selected rows should remain highlighted

2. **Scrollbar Dragging Test**:
   - Drag scrollbar rapidly up and down
   - Rows should render immediately without gaps
   - No blank spaces should appear during dragging

3. **Image Loading Test**:
   - Scroll rapidly through rows with images
   - Images should load smoothly with fade-in effect
   - No broken image icons should appear
   - Failed images should show placeholder

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and working in:
- Chrome 120+
- Firefox 120+
- Safari 17+
- Edge 120+

All fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing TablixJS features.
